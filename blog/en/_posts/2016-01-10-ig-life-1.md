* **Books**

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002W8QXHW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_bank">59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot</a> by Richard Wiseman.

It is a very fascinating read so far. I especially like the summaries at the end of each chapter.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X47ZVXM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_bank">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World </a> by Cal Newport.

I am a little biased here. I like Cal Newport's previous book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1452462943&sr=1-1&keywords=so+good+they+can%27t+ignore+you" target="_bank">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a> 
and I follow his blog <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/" target="_bank">Study Hacks</a>.
So, naturally, I could not wait to read this book, I almost preordered it back in December. I got Deep Work on its publication date January 5th and 
I just finished reading it today. This book gave me some really good ideas which I am going to implement. More about this book later.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W94FE6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1" target="_bank">Flow</a> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

Just started reading it...


* **Movies**

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_%28film%29" target="_bank">The Big Short</a> by Adam McKay

I really like the movie. The jokes are funny, the conversation are insightful, the acting is superb. I especially liked
Steve Carell's performance. I will definitely watch this movie again.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_Call_%28film%29" target="_bank">Margin Call</a> by J. C. Chandor.

After I was done with The Big Short, I googled for "best movies about finance" and stumbled upon Margin Call. I liked it
even better than The Big Short. The entire movie happens in just over one day (36 hours) and everything happens in one building.
There are no special effects. Under such restrictions, you have to put a lot of thoughts into conversations and the acting has to be excellent.
And Margin Call does not disappoint.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psycho_%28film%29" target="_bank">American Psycho</a> by Marry Haron

Creepy, disturbing and yet fascinating movie. It doesn't matter what you do, how much money you have, how strong or good looking you are.
None of it seems to matter when it comes to happiness and meaningful life. I probably won't watch this movie again but I think
it is worth watching it at least once. It could be a good wakeup call for some people.
