* **Avoiding injuries**

If in doubt, take a day-off, climb at a lower grade or just work out. It's better to miss a day, than a couple weeks
or months.

* **Paying extra attention to fingers**

Finger pulley injuries are by far the most common and dangerous types of injuries in climbing. Warm up your fingers properly.
Let go when holding on becomes dangerous. Learn to recognize these situations.

* **Developing a strong open hand grip**

Most injuries happen from crimping too hard for too long. Learn the open hand grip. Only crimp when you can't open hand.
Avoid crimpy routes when your fingers are already sore. Learn how to let go when crimping becomes dangerous. You can always
try it again.

* **Taking time to warm up properly**

Do it before your climbing session. It should not be hard, strenuous or long. You should enjoy and look forward to it.
Start with easy stretching, continue with climbing the routes you are comfortable with.

* **Taking plenty of rest**

Remember, you get better at climbing when you rest. It's a strenuous activity, give your body plenty of time to recover.
You should feel motivated, focused and syched. If you don't, try resting more. If you don't feel like you are recovering
well from your climbing sessions, try resting more. If you are not sure if you should rest more, you should.

* **Training consistently**

While it is very important to take plenty of rest, it is just as important to train consistently and follow your routine.
If you are well rested and still don't feel like training, do it anyway. It doesn't have be a long, hard or punishing session.
Make your training on such days as enjoyable as possible. Do your favourite routes, take plenty of rest between the routes,
do you favourite finger board exercise, do something you are really good at. Often you find that the hardest part on such days
is to start. If after a couple of routes or exercises, you still don't feel like doing anything, go home and rest.
Come back the next day and do it all over again.

* **Working on the weaknesses**

Everyone has weaknesses. It can be anything: weak open hand or crimping grip, overhang or stemming routes, small crimpy
holds or slopers, being inflexible, not comfortable with big moves, scared of climbing over your last clip, etc.
Make sure you know your weaknesses and the ways to work on them.

* **Mixing different styles of climbing**

Lead climb, boulder, try crack climbing, do slabs, overhang routes, routes with only slopers on it, crimpy routes, stemming
routes. Go to different gyms.
