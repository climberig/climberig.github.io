All programmers slack off. While some programmers can get into the zone for a couple hours with no distractions at all,
others constantly feel an urge to check their email every five minutes, read facebook feed updates and new twitter messages...
This list goes on and on. While slacking for programmers is a part of their creative process, there are better ways to do it.
I call it "slacking like a hacker".

Next time you feel an urge to slack off for a bit, consider doing one of the following instead:

* Sit down with your team mate and do pair-programming or just watch him working for a few minutes. Let him know
what you are doing first, otherwise it is just creepy :).
* Look at the last 10 updates from the repository, read carefully the commit messages, try to understand why certain
code changes have been made. If you don't understand something, go talk to the author of the changes. All programmers
love to talk about their code.
* Document a method, a class, a module or a file that you are currently modifying.
* Run test coverage on the code you are modifying and improve it.
* Review the code of your team mates and leave some meaningful feedback.
* Review the code of someone who is not on your team. The code might not be in the language you are used to. Try to
understand it anyway and leave the feedback.
* Checkout your github feed. Subscribe to some popular projects there, follow some good developers, review their commits.
* Open command line, type `man command_name` and read the output. These would take you off to a good start: man find, man sed, man grep,
man awk, man man, man readline.
* Do 10 pushups.
* Take a walk.

This is just some ideas, use them to create your own list, print it out, put it on your desk and use it next time you feel
the urge. Go through the list in order and pick something that is exciting to you at the moment. If nothing from the list
interest you, then satisfy the urge. This simple exercise will make you more productive, happier and you'll learn a lot.
It will make you a better programmer and, hopefully, a better person.

Are you ready to slack like a hacker?
