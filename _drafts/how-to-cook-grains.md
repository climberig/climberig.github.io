I like all types of grains, my favorites are buckwheat, brown rice and quinoa. The cooking instructions for them
are similar but different and it took me quite a few tries to find the best way to cook them. To save you some time and
frustration, here are the steps.

**Buckwheat**:

* Put water in a pot and cover with a lid. Use the ratio of 2 cups of water to 1 cup of buckwheat. Set the heat to high
and wait for the water to boil
* Once boiled, add buckwheat, keep the lid off
* Wait for the water/buckwheat to come back to a boil, set the heat to low/simmer, cover the pot with the lid and let
it simmer for 12 minutes
* Turn off the heat and let the buckwheat sit for 5-10 minutes

**Brown rice**:

* Put water and rice in a pot, use the ratio of 1.5 cups of water to 1 cup of rice
* Set the heat to high and bring water/rice to a boil uncovered
* Put the lid on the pot, set the heat to low/simmer and let the rice simmer for 20 minutes
* Turn off the heat and let the rice sit for 10-15 minutes

**Quinoa**:

* Put water and quinoa in a pot, use the ratio of 2 cups of water to 1 cup of quinoa
* Set the heat to high and bring water/quinoa to a boil uncovered
* Put the lid on the pot, set the heat to low/simmer and let the quinoa simmer for 15 minutes
* Turn off the heat and let the quinoa sit for 5 minutes

After they are done, I usually scoop some into a bowl, add butter, salt and seeds. I usually use flax, chia and
sesame seeds. Sometimes I mix the seeds together, sometimes I only use one type, flax seeds are my favourites.
Experiment and see what you like better.

I get brown rice and quinoa at Costco, buckwheat at Whole Foods.
