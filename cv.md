![Igor Kuplevich][me]

My name is Igor Kuplevich. I live in Berkeley (California) and work as a software engineer at <a href="http://fitbit.com" target="_blank">Fitbit</a>. I like solving problems and mastering skills 
<a href="/skills" target="_blank">http://climberig.com/skills</a>. I enjoy hard work and thrive when faced with difficulties.<br/>
As an engineer, I have created many projects used by millions of people every day. I've done some cool things outside of work too <a href="/outside-work" target="_blank">http://climberig.com/outside-work</a>.

After more than a decade in the software industry, I have a couple things to say about software, engineers, interviews, motivation <a href="/misc-eng" target="_blank">http://climberig.com/misc-eng</a>.

**Work**

* Fitbit, June 2012 - current, Software Engineer
* University of California Berkeley, May 2009 - June 2012, Software Engineer
* Other software companies since 2005

**Education**

I graduated from Belarussian State University (best university in Belarus) in 2008 with Masters in Mathematics. Additionally, I took
computer science classes and have worked as a software engineer since I was 19 years old.


**Memorable Software Projects**

* **Sleep Insights, Fitbit**<br/>
I worked with our research team to develop an algorithm that delivers sleep insights to users based on their data. The insights are
relevant, intelligent and help users to sleep better. Besides the algorithm, I also:<br/>
-- designed and implemented the entire thing. It took me more than a year, during which I wrote code every day<br/>
-- implemented a testing framework to emulate a user. Such tests are easy to write and they are fast. The framework of 200 lines of code gave 
80% coverage to 20k lines of code. These tests allow me to release to production without manual testing<br/>
-- invented my own java coding style to keep my code short, consistent but fun to work with and readable (very hard balance to achieve)<br/>
-- implemented an i18n mechanism to deliver content in multiple languages<br/>
I used **java 8** and **javascript** for the app code, **python** to automate certain maintenance tasks, **cassandra** to store data,
**jenkins** to run tests and deploy; **gradle** to build the app, **kibana** for logs, **graphana** to build performance dashboards, **Intellij**
to write code, **Ubuntu 16.04** to manage all of the above.

* **Smart Sleep, Fitbit**<br/>
Automatic detection of bedtime and waketime based on user data. The project was very heavy on different algorithms including the basic 
morphological functions: dilation, erosion, binary opening and closing. When I initially implemented it, it was only used on a single device.
It is now used on all Fitbits. The core algorithm has not changed much and I've spent very little effort maintaining it. I am very proud of that
fact.

* **My Financial Aid, UC Berkeley**<br/>
Financial Aid Website used by all berkeley students

* **Oh Hell!**<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell" target="_blank">Oh Hell</a> is a card game which I play with my family every Thanksgiving. I first learned how to play in 2015. I thought it was very hard
to keep the score without making mistakes, so I decided to code it. I did it in Python using command line as a client, and then rewrote it
in javascript. <br/>
