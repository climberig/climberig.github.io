I am not quite sure what this blog is going to be about. Most likely, I'll ramble about programming, rock climbing,
exercising, tennis, math and other things that interest me. I'll try to share different internet resources and
websites that I use, write about my favourite books and movies, and collect things that excite and motivate me. The
plan is to post here consistently. Let's see if I can make it happen.
