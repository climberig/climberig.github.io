**My Quests for Knowledge and Skills**

* **Chess, 1996**

One day my friend and I went to a chess club. I had never played chess before and my friend had just learned. He showed me how to move the pieces,
we started the game and I beat him. I really liked the game, could not stop thinking about it and immediately wanted to play another one. When 
I came home, I asked my mother to find me a chessboard. Our neighbour had one, never used and he just gave it to us. I taught my younger brother 
how to play. We played every day, in the morning before school, after school, in the evening before going to bed. We would invite friends, teach 
them how to play and then organize tournaments. We kept the score and it was very competitive. I was carrying the chessboard with me everywhere, 
always looking for new opponents, trying to beat everyone. Two years later, my brother and I were the best players in our county, winning many competitions.

* **Math, 2002**

I was always good at math, it came easy to me. I could just solve problems without studying too much. But I never really cared about it. Playing
soccer with my friends was always more important and a lot more fun. When I was 17 I decided I wanted to study in the best university of Belarus but when I saw their 
requirements for math, I was shocked. I could not even understand the definitions of the problems they asked, let alone solve them. I realized
how low my level of math really was and knew I would never be able to enter the university of my dreams unless I change something. I had one year. It was going to be hard but hey, 
it is only for one year. I went to the local bookstore and got all the math books I could. My schedule was very simple: come home from school, then study math until 9pm, every day. 
No more soccer, no more going outside, not even on the weekend or holidays.  If I solved a problem, I'd put a circle next to it, if I couldn't, I'd put a question mark. 
After a couple days, I would come back and try to solve the ones I could not solve before. It was very motivating when I solved them couple days later with no problems. 
I kept going. Every day, same routine.<br/>
3 months later, I won my county math competition; 6 months later, I scored 96% on my country's math SAT; 9 months later, I was accepted 
into my dream university without any tests (I won their math competition). I could select any faculty/specialty I wanted (I chose math). 9 months 1 day later, I went to
play soccer with my friends.

* **Rock Climbing, 2012**

Growing up, I had climbed all the trees in my grandmother's village and I could easily do 20 pullups, so when my friend took me rock climbing I thought I'd climb the rocks with no problem. I was wrong. 
I could only do simple climbs and would get tired very quickly. It was true, I was strong, but I could not utilize my strength. It was impaired by lack of technique and experience. 
I knew I could do much better, I just needed to train. I bought a membership to the rock gym that same evening and went almost every day. I trained hard and climbed even harder. 
I'd watch climbing videos in my spare time, ask more experienced climbers for advise and then climb and train again. Four years later, I am one of the best and strongest climbers in my gym. 
I still climb almost every day.<br/>

* **Other**

I have used similar approaches and techniques to gain other skills including: english, tennis, running.
