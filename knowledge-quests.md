**My Quests for Knowledge and Skills**

* **Chess, 1996**

One day my friend and I went to a chess club. I had never played chess before and my friend had just learned. He showed me how to move the pieces,
we started the game and I beat him. I really liked the game, could not stop thinking about it and immediately wanted to play another one. When 
I came home, I asked my mother to find me a chessboard. Our neighbour had one, never used and he just game it to us. I taught my younger brother 
how to play. We played every day, in the morning before school, after school, in the evening before going to bed. We would invite friends, teach 
them how to play and then organize tournaments. We kept the score and it was very competitive. I was carrying the chessboard with me everywhere, 
always looking for new opponents, trying to beat everyone. Two years later, my brother and I were the best players in our county winning many competitions

* **Math, 2002**

I was always good at math but it came easy to me. I could just solve problems without studying too much. But I never really cared for it. Playing
soccer with my friends was always more important and a lot more fun. I wanted to study in the best university of Belarus but when I saw their 
requirements for math, I was shocked. I could not even understand the definitions of the problems, let alone solve them. It became apparent to me that
my level of math was really low and I would never be able to enter the university of my dreams. Unless I change something. I had one year. I went to the 
local bookstore and got all the math books I could. My schedule was very simple: come home from school, then study math until 9pm, every day. No more
soccer, no more going outside, not even on the weekend. It was going to be hard but hey, it is only for one year. If I solved a problem, I'd put
a circle next to it, if I could't, I'd put a question mark. After a couple day, I would come back and tried to solve the ones I could 
not solve before. It was very motivating when I solved them couple days later with no problems. I kept going. Every day, same routine.<br/>
3 months later, I won my county math competition, six months later, I scored 96% on my country's math SAT, 9 months later, I was accepted 
into my university without any tests (I won their math competition). I could select any faculty/specialty I wanted. 9 months 1 day later, I went to
play soccer with my friends again.

* **Rock Climbing, 2012**

My friend took me rock climbing. I had never tried it before. I climbed all the trees in my grandmother's village, could easily do 20 pullups, so
I thought I'd climb the rock with no problem. I was wrong. I could only do simple climbs and would get tired very quickly. It was true, I was strong, but I could
not utilize my strength. It was dwarfed by lack of technique and experience. I knew I could do much better, I just needed to train. I bought the membership that
same evening and went to the gym almost every day ever since. I would train hard but climb even harder. I'd watch climbing videos in my spare time, asked more
experienced climbers for advise and then climb and train again. Four years later, I am one of the best and strongest climbers in my gym. I still climb almost every
day.<br/>

I use similar approaches and techniques to gain other skills, including english, tennis, running.
