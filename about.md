### About me

My name is Igor Kuplevich. I live in Berkeley, California. After spending over 10 years working as a software engineer,
I've decided it was time to work for myself and started my own hedge fund.  

I used to be quite active in competitive programming, especially on leetcode.com. I posted many solutions there, 
some of them even became popular. I no longer have time to do it. All my time is spent parenting my two boys and working on the trading
system for my hedge fund.
