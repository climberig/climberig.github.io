### Things I've done outside of work

-- hiked 30 miles in one day in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park" target="_blank">Yosemite</a> 
(started at 7.10am, finished at around 5pm)

-- did 40 consecutive pullups 

-- convinced my boss to give me time off to do <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> programming challenges. 
Every day for two weeks I'd come to the office and <a href="https://github.com/climberig/ProjectEuler" target="_blank">code puzzles</a> from dawn to dusk

-- bench-pressed 350 pounds

-- travelled to Panama for 7 days with just a tiny backpack

-- wrote code while on a ferry from Stockholm to Helsinki. The sea was choppy, the internet was slow but it did not matter

-- caught an 80 pounds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish" target="_blank">sail fish</a> in Costa Rica (best work out of my life)
