**What's the hardest problem in software?**

P versus NP? I don't think so. In my opinion, it is finding **meaning and motivation** (M&M). This problem is not specific to 
software.I believe we could have cured cancer, traveled to space, eradicated poverty and... solved P versus NP had we solved 
the M&M. Is it possible to solve it? I wish I knew. So far, I've only managed to mitigate it.

**What do you think about interviews?**

Let's not kid ourselves, an interview is largely a lottery. I can ace all your questions but I am so demotivated and washed out, 
I'll never really help you. I'll do the minimum amount of work required and go home. Or maybe I fail the interview miserably, but 
when given a chance, I will rise to the challenge and be your best employee. I can also be too nervous and fail even if I knew how 
to solve a problem or perhaps I can provide a brilliant solution but only because I just read about it. If you are trying to determine
if I am a good cultural fit, then you are out of luck as well. We are engineers, not psychologists. Can professional psychologists 
even do it in 45 minutes? Can anyone?

**How would you do the interview then?**

I would ask an engineer to show me his code, in his favourite environment (OS, IDE, editor). Does he know how to use his tools? Is he 
passionate about his code? How does he work with it? Can he run his tests? Maybe he can teach me something. Maybe he can also look at 
my code and tell me something I can improve, maybe some useful refactoring. Maybe there is a bug in my code? How would he fix it? What
is his favourite command line command? What is his favourite bug? How did he fix it? I also think the interviewee should interview his 
interviewers. It should be more bilateral, we both need each other. Maybe when I look at your code, I would not want to work for you.
We'll save each other a lot of time.

**How do you define a great programmer?**

A great programmer writes correct and efficient programs in timely manner.

**What's a single most important quality of a programmer?**

The ability to focus and work hard (not to be confused with being busy). 

**Is there anything you wish programmers did more often?**

I wish we thought about complexity more. We keep introducing new frameworks, libraries, use cases while not paying enough attention to the 
complexity they bring. Maybe you can validate email without using that buggy library? You'll finally learn regular expressions. You have to 
put multiple if/else statements throughout your code to implement the new use case. It's time to step back and think. Maybe the easiest way
to solve it is not the right way? Maybe it is time to refactor the code. Just because you can put a couple if/else's in two minutes doesn't 
make you a good or efficient programmer. I wish we spent more time learning the basics including the tools we use every day, improving and 
simplifying legacy projects instead of always pursuing the next big thing.

**What do you think about coding styles?**

I like code bases with different code styles. If I see some good ideas and tricks, I change my style accordingly. I don't think it's a good 
idea to force everyone to use a single style. Some people think that different styles make code harder to read and understand. I don't think 
so. Bad names, verbose methods, unused code, outdated documentation, inconsistent formatting - this is what makes it harder. A single style 
won't help with that.

**What's your favourite command line command?**

`Less` (I use it to monitor logs). I also like to use 

```bash
 eject /dev/sdb; udiskctl power-off -b /dev/sdb
``` 
to unmout and disconnect the usb or external hard-drive.

**I like**

-- updating my working environment first thing in the morning (even before my coffee)<br/>
-- uninterrupted deep work for many hours<br/>
-- simplifying everything<br/>
-- Mr. Robot<br/>
-- passionate strong-opinionated people<br/>
-- code reviews done from IDE<br/>
-- linux and command line

**I dislike**
-- inconsistent code style<br/>
-- unused code<br/>
-- verbose names<br/>
-- code reviews done from the browser<br/>
-- windows os<br/>
-- todo's and outdated documentation in the code<br/>
-- recurrent meetings
